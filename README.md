# NLP-JSON

## Version pre-alpha 0.001

NLP JSON Schema is a standard middle-ware type for the transfer of NLP output from various NLP pipelines and chains to a uniform JSON format.

This project provides the NLP-JSON specification, a proposed JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format and JSON Schema for Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotations and example use-cases for common NLP pipelines like [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/), [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/), [LingPipe](http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/), and so on.

The proposed schema provides an abstraction and normalization layer, and a uniform API for NLP annotations generated by various heterogeneous NLP pipelines and components.

An exhaustive list of major NLP components is provided in the whitepaper (Cavar et al., to appear 2019, see on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/)) that describes the different data structures that these components can generate. For the majority of these components, the output conversion to NLP-JSON is explained and discussed in the whitepaper. In addition to a detailed description of the NLP-JSON schema properties, various NLP-JSON examples are provided and discussed.

The NLP-JSON schema provides a wider annotation framework than most common NLP-pipelines might need. There are various related projects that will explain the advanced properties of the NLP-JSON format.
